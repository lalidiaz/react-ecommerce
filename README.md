## A Demo E-commerce Project

Welcome to iGlam! This website is a demonstration project showcasing my frontend development skills. While iGlam appears to be a luxurious skincare e-commerce platform, it's important to note that this is a fictional business created solely for portfolio purposes.

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack

- React.js
- Mongo DB
- Typescript
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Daisy UI component based library

### Key Features

- Responsive design
- Shopping cart functionality
- Product filtering and search
- User authentication flow

I'll help you add a new section explaining the platform's functionality. Here's the updated markdown:
